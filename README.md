# How to use CookMe? #

Visit https://cookme-93f92.firebaseapp.com/. *(keep in mind that the first time you visit, it might be a little slow to load. Try refreshing! (database processes need to start up))*
Feel free to browse top recipes which appear on the landing page, or search some recipes from the _**Search**_ button.

# Authentication #

When you feel you want to use all of CookMe's functionality, head to the _**Register**_ page. You'll need to fill out some information about yourself, create a username and password, and you're in! Don't worry, all data you enter is transferred only over secure connections.

# Your new profie #

Having created your user account, you can now visit your profile page. When you use CookMe for a little while, your uploaded recipes, posts and collections will be available to see on your page. For now, you can head to the _**Update equipment**_ menu and add all kitchenware you own, for future reference.

# Uploading Recipes #

When you log in, you will notice that a few extra buttons have suddenly appeared on the navigation bar, one of them being _**Upload recipe**_. There you can describe the ingredients, steps and go into a lot of detail on preparing your favorite recipe. Make it a good one!

# Writing posts #

Having completed your first recipe, you can browse other people's ideas. When a meal catches your attention, cook it and share your experience! Clicking the _**I cooked that!**_ button on the recipe page will open up a modal form, where you can share what you liked, didn't like and would change, so others can learn from your words. Your post will be visible, along with all other relevant posts, on the bottom of the recipe page!

# Making collections #

Let's say you stumbled upon a recipe which really piqued your interest. Maybe you'd like to save it for later? Just click the _**Add to collection**_ button on the recipe page and choose the collection! If you don't have quite the right collection started, you can create it from the same menu.

# Creating menus #

Want to plan a full day's or week's menu? CookMe's got you covered. In the _**Create Menu**_ section, you can browse all recipes and search for just the right ones to add to your menu. When you've got them picked, choose a name for your menu and proceed to our Menu Editor. There, you can use the drag-and-drop functionality and arrange them just right! When you're done, your new menu can be found on your profile page. (*not yet though, I forgot to do it*). Or if you'd like, you can let CookMe choose your menu! With your preferences in mind, the system will pick some recipes on your behalf. All you have to do is cook!
